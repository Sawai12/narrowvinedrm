## (2021.8.26) New Version Released: https://github.com/WHTJEON/narrowvine-reborn
## (2021.6.1) Widevine revoked every exploit used in this script. It's dead.<br>It is reported to still work in some sites, but most of them are revoked.

The Ultimate Widevine Content Ripper (KEY Extract + Download + Decrypt)<br>
**Extracting decryption keys only supports Windows.** 
- If you are using a different platform, you would need to extract decryption keys using Widevine L3 decryptor from a Windows Machine first and paste them into the script. 
- This is a combination of widevine-dl and widevineclient3 in my repo. 
- This exploit will be patched by Widevine in May 31st, 2021.

## Requirements
- ffmpeg, yt-dlp, aria2 (These must be in PATH. If you want to skip this procedure, download from [Releases](https://github.com/WHTJEON/narrowvine/releases))
- pycryptodome

```
$ pip install ffmpeg yt-dlp aria2p pycryptodome
```
or just simply
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Enter `MPD_URL` and `LICENSE_URL` of Widevine Content
